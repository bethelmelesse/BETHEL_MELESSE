## Projects & Open Source Contributions 


### Data Collection and Fine-tuning of LLMs for Low-Resource Languages on Consumer Hardware (2023*)

- Filtered all data from $>1000$ TB of Common Crawl for low-resource languages for < 2$.
- Evaluated capability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages.
- Fine-tuned multi-lingual LLMs using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on consumer GPUs.
- Code will be released as open-source, to enable any researcher to build LLMs affordably.

### Information Retrieval for Low-Resource Languages (2022)

- Trained a BERT-like transformer Language-Model (LM) for IR for African languages.
- Compared traditional IR approaches (tf-idf, BM25) vs. SOTA approaches.

### Generalized Output Spaces for Classification Models (2022-2023*)

- Improved cross-domain/cross-task generalization of classifiers by fusing multiple descriptions of classes/tasks.
- Achieved SOTA zero-shot performance in multiple datasets. (ongoing)

### Open Source Contributions
- Added support for more languages to “[AllTrans](https://github.com/akhilkedia/AllTrans)”, an android application translator.
- Added extra languages to “[Android-Auto-Localization](https://github.com/akhilkedia/Android-Auto-Localization_Translate-Strings.XML)”, to localize Android application’s resources.
