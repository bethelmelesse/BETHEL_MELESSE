## Experience 
### ML Researcher, 2022-2024
Database and Dependable Computing Lab

Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea
#### Extracting Low-Resource Datasets for Affordable Adaptation of LLMs:
- Processed > 1000 TB of Common Crawl for < 2 $, extracting SOTA monolingual datasets for 7 languages.
- Improved multi-lingual LLMs using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on consumer GPUs.
- Published in Proceedings of Symposium of the Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences.
- Code released at  “[UnifiedCrawl](https://github.com/nonamework/UnifiedCrawl)”
  
#### Generalized Output Spaces for Classifiers:
- Improved cross-domain/cross-task generalization of multi-modal classifiers by fusing descriptions of classes/tasks.
- Achieved SOTA zero-shot performance on CIFAR, RCV1, 20 NG (under review for publication).


## Projects & Open Source Contributions 

### Information Retrieval for Low-Resource Languages (2022)

- Trained a BERT-like transformer Language-Model (LM) for IR for African languages.
- Compared traditional IR approaches (tf-idf, BM25) vs. SOTA approaches.

### Open Source Contributions
- Added support for more languages to “[AllTrans](https://github.com/akhilkedia/AllTrans)”, an android application translator.
- Added extra languages to “[Android-Auto-Localization](https://github.com/akhilkedia/Android-Auto-Localization_Translate-Strings.XML)”, to localize Android application’s resources.
